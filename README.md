# 👋🏼 Hi there!
 
- Check out this simple Flutter project I've developed. It consists of three main screens: login, signup, and the home page for online store.
 
- The focus in this project was primarily on UI design, with basic logic handling. Cleanliness and simplicity in the code were considered to facilitate understanding and maintenance in the future.
 
- Feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions to improve the project. Thanks! 🚀
